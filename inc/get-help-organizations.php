        <h2>Emergency Food And Shelter Programs</h2>
        <p>We want long-term solutions for our community. But emergencies happen. We’re grateful for the $100,000+ in federal funds Whatcom County receives annually to supplement local emergency food and shelter programs. We serve as the fiscal agent for these funds and work with local government and non-profit organizations to determine allocations to local programs.</p>
        <p>Grant applications are accepted and reviewed annually.</p>
