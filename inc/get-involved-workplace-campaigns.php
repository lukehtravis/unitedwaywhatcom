      <h2>What is a workplace campaign?</h2>
      <div class="small-side">
        <p>Here at United Way of Whatcom County, we conduct more than 150 workplace campaigns annually. During a workplace campaign, CEO’s and volunteer campaign coordinators encourage their employees and co-workers to donate to United Way of Whatcom County’s Community Impact Fund. Workplace campaigns are held at small businesses and large corporations in a variety of industries ranging from construction to banking. They are the backbone of our fundraising activities.</p>

        <h2>Sponsors</h2>
        <p>Our Community Builder Sponsors underwrite our annual campaign. They provide the support we need for events, temporary staff, advertisements, and campaign collateral. This ensures donations are preserved to be reinvested into service programs and projects that benefit local residents.</p>
        <p>Being a sponsor makes good business sense. Studies show consumers are more likely to support organizations that are involved in the local community. Your brand matters. Build a brand based on philanthropy and we all win.</p>
