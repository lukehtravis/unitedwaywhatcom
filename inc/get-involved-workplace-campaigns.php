      <div class="small-side">
        <p>Here at United Way of Whatcom County, we conduct more than 150 workplace campaigns annually. During a workplace campaign, CEO’s and volunteer campaign coordinators encourage their employees and co-workers to donate to United Way of Whatcom County’s Community Impact Fund. Workplace campaigns are held at small businesses and large corporations in a variety of industries ranging from construction to banking. They are the backbone of our fundraising activities.</p>

        <h2>Sponsors</h2>
        <p>Our Community Builder Sponsors underwrite our annual campaign. They provide the support we need for events, temporary staff, advertisements, and campaign collateral. This ensures donations are preserved to be reinvested into service programs and projects that benefit local residents.</p>
        <p>Being a sponsor makes good business sense. Studies show consumers are more likely to support organizations that are involved in the local community. Your brand matters. Build a brand based on philanthropy and we all win.</p>

        <h2>Loaned Executives</h2>
        <p>Our Loaned Executive Program provides a unique opportunity for the professional development of emerging leaders. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <p><b>Give something.</b> Lend us an employee who is an emerging leader within your company. The individual works half-time for us and half-time for you from mid-September through mid-November. You continue to furnish all of their wages.</p>
        <p><b>Get something.</b> As part of our campaign team, your staff member receives more than just education about United Way and the impact we make. We’ll provide your executive with training on local community issues, public speaking, sales, and account management.</p>
        <p><b>Get a little more.</b> As a loaned executive, your employee will be responsible for 15-25 accounts. Each of these accounts represents a business conducting a United Way workplace campaign. By way of your colleague, you’ll get your name out to dozens of businesses and be seen as a true philanthropic leader across our community.</p>
        <p><b>And even more.</b> We’ll issue you a $10,000 sponsorship credit for each loaned executive you provide. This means you’ll get all of the benefits we give to our Mt. Baker sponsors. Add in a cash sponsorship or an additional loaned executive to receive title sponsor perks as a Cascade sponsor.</p>
