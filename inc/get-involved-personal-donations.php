The Society is named for Alexis de Tocqueville, a Frenchman who, in the early 1800’s, traveled throughout America and wrote extensively of his admiration for America’s spirit of giving. Reflecting this spirit, members of our Tocqueville Society demonstrate the highest level of individual support for United Way of Whatcom County, contributing an annual gift of $10,000 or more. </p>
